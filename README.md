# Danger Will Hoginson, Danger!

### Oh no! Schmuziges hog GalaxySNote7 is at it again!

No longer content grounding plains and delaying flights, this greased up hog is now stirring up trouble in the pig pen!

We know he is a filthy fellow, but which one? Rumor has it he was hanging out with Truffle Shuffle earlier, cramming his greedy little snout into the ground.

Find GalaxySNote7 and help him alert his fellow hogs when someone touches his snout.

### Deliverables:
- See the sample video stored in ./public for an idea on how to get started
- On click, GalaxySNote7 should trigger a change in state for the pig pen's environment.
- Galaxy and his hog cadre should react to this change in their environment and use the ```exclaim``` method to render their warnings.
- After at least two seconds, things in the pig pen should cool off, and the environment should return to normal.
- Understanding this, draw out the component tree with your group.
- Think about what components own what information.
- Adhere to React patterns --> information propagates up and down the component tree, but not sideways
- Once GalaxySNote7 is successfully instigating panick when he is tickled, incorporate the sounds where you see fit!
